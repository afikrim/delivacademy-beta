# Install & Configure Laravel

## Download XAMPP

First of all, you can download XAMPP from the official website: [https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). There are several versions of XAMPP, please choose a version that have PHP 7.4 or PHP 8 in it. Then install it right away.

When installing, please make sure that you at least check PHP and MySQL from the available options.

## Download Composer

After your installation with XAMPP is completed, you can continue to the next step to install composer. You can get composer install from here:

[MacOS / Linux](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos)

[Windows](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows)

## Create a Laravel Project

After PHP, MySQL, and Composer are installed on our computer, we can create our first Laravel project by running the command below in our terminal,

```sh
composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-app
```

After the command above run completely, you can see that there is a new folder created with the name `laravel-app`. If you open `laravel-app` folder you'll find many folders or files generated by Laravel. Folders and files inside `laravel-app` are gonna make a structure like this,

```sh
laravel-app
├── app                 # Main application (Models, Controllers, etc)
├── bootstrap           # Laravel bootstrap
├── config              # Laravel Configuration
├── database            # DB Migration, Seeder, Factory
├── public              # Publicly access files
├── resources           # Frontend components (Views, Css, Js, etc)
├── routes              # Application routing
├── storage             # Application storage (Cache, rendered view, etc)
├── tests               # Application test cases
├── vendor              # 3rd Party library
├── artisan             # Laravel artisan file
├── composer.json
├── composer.lock
├── .editorconfig
├── .env
├── .env.example
├── .gitattributes
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── phpunit.xml
├── README.md
├── server.php
├── .styleci.yml
└── webpack.mix.js
```

## Start a Laravel App

We can start our Laravel App by running,

```sh
php artisan serve
```

After we start our application there'll be messages on our terminal that show a url to access our server.

```sh
Starting Laravel development server: http://127.0.0.1:8000
[Mon Jan 31 15:57:14 2022] PHP 8.0.14 Development Server (http://127.0.0.1:8000) started
```

If we open http://127.0.0.1:8000 we will see Laravel Welcome page. If you guys wonder where is the welcome page come from, we can try to check our `routes/web.php` file. In that file you'll see something like this,

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

The code above means, if there are any requests to the path '/' we will respond by showing the welcome page from the view folder.

We can try customising file `welcome.blade.php` and refresh the browser to see our recent changes.
